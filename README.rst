Elysium
=======

Elysium is a LimeChat theme meant to be light, airy, and Mac-like. It's based on `Rik's fork of Whisper <https://github.com/Rik/limechat-whisper/>`_, but everybody has their own opinions, don't they? :-)

Installation
============

Toss ``Elysium.css`` and ``Elysium.yaml`` into ``~Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes``.

Design Goals
============

* Make unimportant stuff fade into the background. For example, the typical IRC noise of joins and parts is low-contrast.
* Make normal stuff readable. Nearly-black on white is hard to beat, and columnized nicks are easy to scan.
* Make important stuff noticeable. Highlights and (as a navigational aide) your own messages stand out with tasteful background colors.
